# Claude project rules — netsec.github.io

Read by Claude Code on every session in this repository. Codifies the
standing constraints the maintainer has set for AI-assisted work, so
they survive context-window expiry. Update via PR when a rule shifts.

The single human reader of this file is the maintainer (Dr Arthur
Laudrain). Keep it terse — every word here is read once per session
and costs context.

---

## 1. Language & translation

- **British English** in all user-facing copy (site pages, the
  documentation pack, the accessibility statement, CHANGELOG release
  notes, GitHub Release bodies, PR descriptions where they'll be
  read by COST evaluators or members). Internal commit messages and
  code comments can be more relaxed but should not flip mid-document.
- **No machine translation, ever.** FR and DE variants are
  translated by hand. The beta-translation ribbon on `*.fr.html` /
  `*.de.html` says *"Traduction manuelle"* / *"Manuell übersetzt"*.
  If you find any user-facing copy that implies machine translation,
  fix it (see PR #111 for the canonical correction).

## 2. Pull-request workflow

- **Auto-merge by default.** Open the PR with `gh pr create`, then
  arm auto-merge with `gh pr merge --auto --squash`. CI checks (the
  link checker on every HTML-touching PR + CodeQL) will hold the
  merge if anything is wrong.
- **Carve-out: release notes.** When cutting a release via
  `scripts/release.sh`, eyeball the lede + themes + index before
  confirming the publish prompt. The maintainer expects to see the
  proposed notes; the carve-out exists precisely because publication
  to GitHub Releases is harder to undo than a merge.
- **Squash, not merge commits.** Every PR ends as a single commit on
  `main`. The release-cutter then writes the release commit on top.

## 3. Open a GitHub issue for every deferred item

Whenever you identify work that won't ship *this turn* — a bug, a
feature need, a structural follow-up, a "queued for later" finding —
**open a GitHub issue before the session ends.** The audit trail
self-references that way; loose ends survive context-window expiry
and release cycles.

### When to open an issue

- A **bug** you've spotted but aren't fixing now (because it's
  out of scope for the current PR, needs further investigation,
  or pairs better with future work). Example: PR #117 fixed the
  libjpeg-determinism symptom with a hash check; the deeper
  question of whether photos belong in git at all became
  [#119](https://github.com/EISSeuropa/netsec.github.io/issues/119).
- A **feature need** that surfaced from a user journey, an audit,
  or a maintainer conversation but isn't being scoped this turn.
- A **structural follow-up** — i.e. the current PR papered over a
  symptom but the root cause needs a different fix.
- A **deferral with a tag** — "queued for v1.6.0", "after public
  push", "needs design pass". Anything that ends up in the
  audit-trail tables of `docs/launch-qa-2026.md` or the *Under
  watch* section of `docs/roadmap-2026.md` belongs in an issue too.

### When **not** to open an issue

- Work that's shipping *this turn* — the PR is the record.
- Pure observations that need no action (e.g. *"the chevron
  rotation reads as identity in headless `getComputedStyle`; CSS
  rule is correct, real-browser confirmation pending"*).
- Duplicates — always `gh issue list --state open --search "..."`
  first, and prefer linking + commenting on an existing issue.
- Trivial inline fixes you can do in seconds without context
  switch.

### Issue template (informal — there are no `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` files)

```markdown
## What's happening
One paragraph + a concrete repro or pointer.

## Why it matters
One paragraph. User impact, audit-trail context, or accessibility /
compliance angle.

## Fix path (or fix options)
Specific enough that a future maintainer can pick it up without
re-deriving the analysis. Code paths, file names, line numbers.

## Target
Milestone or version, e.g. "v1.6.0 / v1.7.0".
```

Labels — use the standard set already present in this repo (`bug`,
`enhancement`, `documentation`). Don't invent new labels without
asking; the label set is small on purpose.

### Cross-reference

When an issue closes a deferred row in an audit doc (e.g. a finding
in `docs/launch-qa-2026.md`, an "Under watch" entry in
`docs/roadmap-2026.md`, or a "needs follow-up" note in the
accessibility statement) — **edit the audit doc to link the new
issue.** Status should read e.g. "open (tracked in #119)" rather
than the dangling "deferred".

See PRs #115 and #124 for the canonical pattern.

## 4. Release-notes format

The hybrid format is documented at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`,
mirrored in `docs/admin-guide.md` *Cutting a release*, and
restated in `scripts/release.sh`'s header. Every release section
follows it; v1.0.0 → v1.5.0 were retrofitted to match.

Short version: **lede + 2-4 themed `### sub-sections` + canonical
`### Index of changes`**. Self-policing tier — patch releases skip
the lede + themes and ship the index only.

Hard rule: **no hard wraps in prose.** One source line per
paragraph / bullet / blockquote. GitHub Releases renders soft `\n`
as `<br>` and would otherwise produce visibly narrow prose.

## 5. Working tree hygiene

- Never leave the working tree dirty across PR boundaries. If a
  script (e.g. `sync-bios.py`, `build-search.sh`) modifies tracked
  files as a side-effect of a verification run, decide whether the
  modification is part of the current PR (include it) or an
  unrelated drift (revert before committing).
- The weekly bios-sync workflow is structurally tuned to produce
  zero dirty files when no submitter has substantively changed
  their entry (PR #117). If you see the workflow trip an
  apparently-empty PR, that's a regression — open an issue and
  investigate before silencing.

## 6. Accessibility & i18n cadence

- The accessibility statement at `/accessibility.html` (+ FR + DE)
  is bumped on every release that touches a11y conformance,
  audit results, or a known-limitations list. Version footer:
  `v<N>.<M> · prepared <date> · supersedes v<prev> · next
  scheduled review <date+1y>`.
- FR / DE drift checker (`scripts/check-i18n-drift.py`) runs in CI
  on every HTML-touching PR. When it flags drift, refresh the
  translation manually before merging.

*This file is short on purpose. If you need to add a rule, add it
here; if you need to add an example, prefer linking a PR / commit /
issue so this file stays a reference rather than a tutorial.*
